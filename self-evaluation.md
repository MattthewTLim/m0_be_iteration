# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel a bit more prepared after the excercise, the hardest 
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I for sure unproductively and productively struggled on this one. The last question where we needed to print only words with 3 characters was a bit difficult and required a lot of research. I did get frustrated and stepped away. Luckily when i CAM BACK i was able to figure it out and that felt great!
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
After getting stuck on the second question it seems that familirizing myself with more methods will be useful to solving these types of things.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
A question I had was that my code was unable to run with just one "end" at the end it was only after adding a second one that my code would run. I am not sure why this worked and would like to know why.
